# Carla-setup

This is my custom setup on carla simulator 

Please read a carla simulator page on this https://carla.readthedocs.io/en/latest/start_quickstart/

My own is to using a binary from carla source because it has latest carla distriutins, as we know, to work with carla_ros_bridge on Ros 1 you need a Ubuntu 20, and a carla version that available on Ubuntu 20 repo's iis version 13
But, I want the latest version, that is 15, but you can still fine with version 13 as well

When you read it, you will be going to this repo, choose your version and download it, the most important file is the first one : https://github.com/carla-simulator/carla/blob/master/Docs/download.md
